Tartu University's Autonomous Driving Lab has managed toget the driving recordings obtained with the self-driving Lexuson Rally Estonia tracks. The problem they are facing is thatcurrently the dataset contains information that they don'tneed or that would influence the outcome. Therefore thedataset is unusable at the moment. That's the part where ourteam comes in to help them clean the dataset into an usableone.
